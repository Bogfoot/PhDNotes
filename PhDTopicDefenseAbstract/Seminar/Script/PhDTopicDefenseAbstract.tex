\begin{abstract}
Entanglement is a key resource of future quantum technologies. For that reason, it will be essential to distribute 
it in quantum networks between many and possibly very distant communication parties. To this end, it is essential 
to generate the photons at a wavelength that is compatible with existing fiber network infrastructure. Such networks typically feature 
very low loss for photons in the O and C band (1310nm and 1550nm, respectively). To more 
efficiently use telecom fibers for many users, the available bandwidth is split into frequency windows to enable dense wavelength 
division multiplexing (DWDM). In the present thesis, we will implement a Sagnac source of entanglement for photons around 1560nm 
that is sufficiently narrowband for the entangled photons to fit into specific DWDM frequency channels. To generate the 
entangled photons, we will use a 50 mm long nonlinear crystal inside a Sagnac interferometer. We will first 
implement and characterize this source in our laboratory and later use it for demonstrating entanglement distribution over in an existing 
fiber network. The wavelength of the pump laser will be stabilized to an absorption line in a Rubidium gas cell. 
With our help, an identical source will be set up by partners at the Jozef Stefan Institute. This will allow us to demonstrate the teleportation of entanglement 
(entanglement swapping) by performing a Bell-state measurement on two entangled photons from those two independent and distant sources. This technique is a prerequisite for quantum 
repeaters, which will be essential to distribute entanglement over arbitrary long distances in future global quantum networks. In particular, even the low losses of photons in 
the C band will exponentially grow with the distance. This limits the efficient distribution of entanglement to distances of a few hundred kilometers.
The present work will not only feature the first realization of a source of entanglement in Slovenia but also the first realization of teleportation.\\

\section{Contents and introduction}
Today I will be speaking to you about my a part of my thesis, which is generating and teleporting entanglement for quantum networks. I will begin with a bit of theory,
where I will explain the basics of the Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC). Here I will speak a bit about Phase Matching and how we try to optimize it in the lab. I will also
speak a bit about how we plan on Distributing Entanglement, so Entanglement Teleportation and Swapping.
Then I will speak about the present state that we are dealing with in the lab and how far we have gone so far.

\section{Motivation}
Pretty much the enterity of my project is in the scope of the SiQUID project. The goal of this project is to create a Slovenian Quantum Network, train young researchers in the field of Quantum Technologies, as well as 
creating the sources of entanglement needed for entanglement based Quantum Key Distribution. The main goal for me in this regard would be to create a bright source of entanglement using a Sagnac interferometer. The reason we 
chose a Sagnac in this case is due to its long term vibrational stability, and it's a convenient way to do so as it allows for a compact design. A possible downside to this is that the alignment of this type of 
interferometer is a bit tedious, as you have to perfectly overlap two beams within the interferometer, and in the crystal.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion}
SPDC is a process in which a pump photon of frequency $\omega_p$ gets "downconverted" to two or more photons of lower frequency,
usually denoted as $\omega_s$ and $\omega_i$. These output photons can have the same frequency,
and thus this can be a degenerate process, or they can have different frequencies, or being non-degenerate.
When we started this entire design process, we wanted to have a degenerate process, as we would be able to separate
the two photons based on their polarization. This design utilited a type-II process, meaning that we would be able 
to separate the two photons on the output of the PBS.
There are also type-I and type-0 processes. In type-I the output photons are orthogonal to the pump photon, while in the type-0 process the pump and output photons have the same polarization.

\subsection{Types of processes}
There are three different types of processes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Type-0 is one in which a photon of some linear polarization, say $\ket{H}$ gets downconverted
into two photons of lower energies of the same polarization - o $\rightarrow$ o + o. This process used to be physically impossible to produce 
as the phase matching condition $k_1 + k_2 = k_3 = \frac{n \omega_3}{c} = \frac{n \omega_1}{c} + \frac{n \omega_2}{c}$ is impossible to achieve
in most cases.
	\item Type-I is similar to type-0, except that the produced two photons are orthogonally polarized to the input photon - o $\rightarrow$ e + e
	\item In type-II instead you get two orthogonal polarizations out from the crystal. e $\rightarrow$ e + o
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crystals}
The first important step is to choose the correct material for the job. In this case, no ordinary material can be used, 
as the phase matching condition $k_1 + k_2 = k_3 = \frac{n \omega_3}{c} = \frac{n \omega_1}{c} + \frac{n \omega_2}{c}$ is impossible
to satisfy in most cases as $n_1 \left(	\omega_1 \right) < n_2 \left(	\omega_2 \right) < n_3 \left(	\omega_3 \right)$ for $\omega_1 < \omega_2 < \omega_3$.

\subsection{Phase Matching}
What is Phase Matching? % NOTE: DO THIS
% NOTE: Add a slide after Phase Matching slide regarding type-0,-I,-II.
% NOTE: Mention the crystal properties - anisotropic stuff
