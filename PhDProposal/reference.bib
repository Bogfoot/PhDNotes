	                demonstrate drastic improvement of the efficiency at telecom
	                wavelength by using two ultra-bright entangled photon sources
	                and four highly efficient superconducting nanowire single

	                count rate of 108 counts per second, which is three orders

	                entangled photon source at room temperature. Based on a
	                30-mm-long periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate
	                crystal, the source produces non-collinear, type-0,
	                phase-matched, degenerate photons at 810 nm with spectral
	                brightness as high as ~0.41 ± 0.02 (~0.025 ± 0.02) MHz/mW/nm
	                for multi (single) mode fiber coupling. So far, this is the
	                highest number of degenerate photons generated using a
	                continuous-wave laser pumped bulk crystal and detected using
	                multimode fiber. We have studied the dependence of pump
	                focusing on the brightness of the generated photons collected
	                using both multimode, and single mode fibers. For a fixed pump
	                power and crystal parameters, the SPDC source has an optimum
	                pump waist radius producing maximum number of paired photons.
	                Combining the crystal in a novel system architecture comprised
	                with Sagnac interferometer and polarizing optical elements, the
	                source produces polarization entangled photon states with high
	                spectral brightness. Even in the absence of any phase
	                compensation, the entangled photon states detected using single
	                mode fiber have a Bell’s parameter, S = 2.63 ± 0.02, violating
	                the Bell’s inequality by nearly 32 standard deviations and
	                fidelity of 0.975. The compact footprint, robust design, and
	                room temperature operation, make our source ideal for various

	abstractNote = {In recent years, Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beams have
	                been applied in optical communications to improve channel
	                capacity and spectral efficiency. However, in practical
	                applications, OAM information is often imprinted on
	                short-wavelength light beams. How to completely transfer this
	                information to the O-band to achieve long-distance transmission
	                has not been conveniently achieved through most traditional
	                methods. We studied the differential frequency experiment of
	                OAM-carrying beams from both theoretical and experimental
	                facets. In the periodic polarization 0 class matched lithium
	                niobate crystal, the difference in frequency between the
	                incident 1950 nm strong pump light and the 780 nm weak input
	                light is achieved, resulting in output light in the O band. The
	                polarization period of the crystal is 20 μm, and the best phase
	                matching is achieved when the temperature is maintained at 41.2
	                °C. At this time, 780 nm vortex light produces 1300 nm vortex
	                light, and the nonlinear conversion efficiency reaches 0.1387%
	                (topological charge number l = 5). During the experiment,
	                momentum, energy, and topological charge are all conserved. Our
	                experiment successfully converted vortex light at 780 nm into
	                vortex light at 1300 nm, paving the way for the subsequent
	                conversion of 780 nm single photons generated by quantum dots
	                carrying OAM into OAM photons in the communication band.},

	abstractNote = {A quantum-light source that delivers photons with a high
	                brightness and a high degree of entanglement is fundamental for
	                the development of efficient entanglement-based quantum-key
	                distribution systems. Among all possible candidates, epitaxial
	                quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the brightest
	                sources of highly entangled photons. However, the optimization

	                developing a novel device consisting of a quantum dot embedded

	                entangled photons with corrected fidelities to a maximally
	                entangled state up to 0.96(1). This hybrid technology has the
