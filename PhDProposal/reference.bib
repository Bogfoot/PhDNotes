The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes.}, number={7198}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Kimble, H.

While fibre-based systems have been shown to be well suited for metropolitan scales, suitable fibre infrastructure may not always be in place. Here, we make the case for an entanglement-based free-space quantum network as a practical and efficient alternative for metropolitan applications. We developed a deployable free-space QKD system and demonstrated its use in realistic scenarios. For a representative 1.7-km free-space link, we showcase its ad hoc deployability and achieve secure key rates of up to 5.7 kbps, with 2.5 kbps in direct noon sunlight. By extrapolating experimental data, we show that kbps key rates are achievable even for 10-km distances and multi-user scenarios. We anticipate that our work will establish free-space networks as a viable solution for metropolitan applications and an indispensable complementary building block in the future global quantum internet.}, number={1}, journal={npj Quantum Information}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Kržič, Andrej and Sharma, Sakshi and Spiess, Christopher and Chandrashekara, Uday and Töpfer, Sebastian and Sauer, Gregor and González-Martín del Campo, Luis Javier and Kopf, Teresa and Petscharnig, Stefan and Grafenauer, Thomas and Lieger, Roland and Ömer, Bernhard and Pacher, Christoph and Berlich, René and Peschel, Thomas and Damm, Christoph and Risse, Stefan and Goy, Matthias and Rieländer, Daniel and Tünnermann, Andreas and Steinlechner, Fabian}, year={2023}, month=sep, pages={1–9}, language={en} }

Here, we present a continuously working, trusted-node free international link between Austria and Slovakia, directly distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs via 248 km of deployed telecommunication fiber. Despite 79 dB loss, we observe stable detected pair rates of 9 s −1 over 110 h. We mitigate multi-pair detections with strict temporal filtering, enabled by nonlocal compensation of chromatic dispersion and superconducting nanowire detectors. Fully automatized active polarization stabilization keeps the entangled state’s visibility at 86% for altogether 82 h. In a quantum cryptography context, this corresponds to an asymptotic secure key rate of 1.4 bits/s and 258 kbit of total key, considering finite-key effects. Our work paves the way for low-maintenance, ultra-stable quantum communication over long distances, independent of weather conditions and time of day, thus constituting an important step towards the quantum internet.}, number={1}, journal={Nature Communications}, author={Neumann, Sebastian Philipp and Buchner, Alexander and Bulla, Lukas and Bohmann, Martin and Ursin, Rupert}, year={2022}, month=oct, pages={6134}, language={en} }
