\section{Description of the immediate research area and its problems}
% (approximately half a page)
%• State and briefly describe the immediate research area in which research will be conducted, and to which an original contribution is expected.
% Emphasise the importance and timeliness of the narrower field.
%• In a few sentences, describe the essence of the problem that will be tackled in the doctoral research and motivate it.
% (a more detailed description is required later in the "dispozicija").

In the rapidly advancing fields of quantum communication and quantum computing, sensing, and simulators
the efficient transfer of secure quantum information is of great importance.
% NOTE: Be more descriptive here if you're gonna use this. Change up the terminoligy, stick to one "processes" -> "experiments"
A key quantum resource is entanglement, which facilitates experiments such as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping.
Conducting these experiments over long distances through optical fibers presents significant challenges due to transmission losses.
To mitigate this, photons must be generated at wavelengths compatible with existing fiber-optic networks,
particularly in the C near-infrared bands where transmission losses are minimal.
These advances contribute to the broader goal of realizing quantum networks,
which require robust capabilities for generating and characterizing (afforementioned quantum processes) quantum coherence and entanglement.
Such networks rely on quantum interconnects (maybe this is not the correct term for this), which convert quantum states between physical systems in a reversible manner,
enabling the distribution of entanglement and the teleportation of quantum states across network nodes \cite{Kimble_2008}.
Additionally, free-space communication methods are being explored for applications in metropolitan areas \cite{Kržić_et_al_2023}.
\par To maximize the efficiency of these telecom networks for multiple users,
the available bandwidth is divided into many frequency channels using Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM).
% NOTE: Move this to methodology or something
The focus of this thesis is to implement a Sagnac interferometer source of polarization-entangled photons centered around 1560 nm,
designed to be sufficiently broadband to accommodate multiple DWDM frequency channels.
These photons will be generated via Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion \cite{jesseSPDC} (SPDC) from a
50 mm (DETAILS LATER) periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nonlinear crystal located at the center of the interferometer.
The source will first be implemented and characterized in the laboratory through techniques such as Quantum State Tomography (QST),
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality measurements \cite{Clauser_Horne_Shimony_Holt_1969},
Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry \cite{Brown_Twiss_1954}, and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry \cite{Hong_Ou_Mandel_1987}.
Subsequently, quantum teleportation \cite{Bouwmeester_Pan_Mattle_Eibl_Weinfurter_Zeilinger_1997}
and entanglement swapping \cite{Jennewein_Weihs_Pan_Zeilinger_2001} experiments will be conducted in collaboration with the Jožef Stefan Institute,
which will develop an identical entanglement source as a part of the collaboration.

These efforts are foundational for the development of quantum repeaters, a critical component for the future global quantum internet.
Quantum repeaters may enable the distribution of entanglement over arbitrarily long distances by overcoming exponential loss scaling,
even in low-loss fiber networks where attenuation low. Without such repeaters, entanglement distribution is limited to distances 
of only a few hundred kilometers. This thesis aims to achieve not only the first realization of a high-yield polarization entanglement
source at non-degenerate frequencies in Slovenia but also to demonstrate quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping.
Ongoing research efforts aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications,
driving the quest for more efficient and accessible quantum systems that could transform various sectors,
including telecommunications and healthcare. As these technologies mature, they are poised to redefine our
understanding of information processing and secure communications in the quantum era.
\par\textbf{Key words: Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Communication, Entanglement Swapping}

\section{Overview of related research and relevant literature}
% (approximately one page)
% • Briefly summarise the state-of-the-art. Review and briefly analyse the relevant literature including the most recent research in the area.
% • Explain how the proposed topic leads on from existing research, and outline the importance of the proposed line of research and the challenges it poses.
% • Explain the relevance and timeliness of the proposed research in the context of the literature reviewed above.
% Think of this as the "big picture" view of where the field currently stands.
% Highlight key milestones in quantum communication and entanglement-based research. For example:
% Mention notable developments in entangled photon sources, including Sagnac interferometers and SPDC.
% Discuss existing quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping experiments, especially those that have focused on telecom wavelengths.
% Reference the challenges of entanglement distribution in fiber networks and the steps taken toward realizing quantum repeaters and networks.
Quantum entanglement sources are pivotal components in the field of quantum mechanics, enabling the generation of entangled states 
that are essential for a range of applications, including quantum computing, cryptography, and communication.
These sources can produce pairs of entangled photons through various techniques, such as Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC),
cavity-enhanced configurations, and quantum dot mechanisms. The ability to create reliable and efficient entangled states
has garnered significant interest due to their implications for advancing quantum technologies and facilitating secure information transfer 
across long distances.
The field has witnessed rapid advancements, particularly in the development of innovative materials and techniques that enhance the 
performance of entanglement sources. Recent breakthroughs, including quantum repeaters and high-fidelity entanglement distribution methods,
have addressed challenges related to signal loss and fidelity in quantum communication networks.
Despite these advances, challenges remain in terms of scalability, resource efficiency, and operational reliability.
Many existing systems struggle to meet the demands for large-scale entanglement required for practical applications,
with issues such as room temperature operation and the complexity of quantum protocols posing significant hurdles.
The importance of entanglement sources in the realm of quantum technologies cannot be overstated,
as they serve as the foundation for cutting-edge innovations in quantum communication, computing, and security.
% Rephrase this: Since the idea of using entanglement for a means of superluminal communication has been debunked \cite{Dieks_1982} there have been a great efforts
% in finding ways to circumvent these restrictions, not in hopes of breaking causality, but in secure commuication between two parties and 
% enhancing cryptographic methods, as well as creating new quantum cryptographic methods of encoding data.
Some of the more feasible ideas like BB84 \cite{BB84} E91 \cite{E91}, and BBM92 \cite{Bennett_Brassard_Mermin_1992} of which now there exist many
devices for a commercial setting, and a large amount of research has been done in improving and fine tuning these methods and 
also providing proofs of security \cite{Rusca_Boaron_Curty_Martin_Zbinden_2018,Rusca_Boaron_Grünenfelder_Martin_Zbinden_2018}.
Unlike prepare-and-measure protocosl like BB84, in order for some of these new methods (E91 and BBM92)
to be used in applications there needs to exist sources of entanglement. After one of the first \cite{Kwiat_1995} demonstrations of a high-intensity
polarization entangled source was realized it also became apparent that they can be fully done on chip \cite{S_G_S_C_F_B_L_G_B_2022} for
frequency-bin entanglement, polarization entangled \cite{L_Z_F_F_L_L_W_R_D_X_etal._2017} and also for hybrid frequency-polarization
entangled states \cite{F_R_D_F_L_M_A_B_D_2023}. Latest research in this field is advancing quickly, specifically for Pulsed Laser (PL) sources which offer higher peak
power and fewer synchronization constraints. 
% NOTE: (Change this as it's not true apparently) 
There are fewer such papers for Continous Wave laser (CW) sources which have lower power and require higher levels of synchronization as
well as postprocessing as we plan to use. A benefit to using CW as compared to PW is less maintainace, for instance in an industrial or government
setting where access may be limited. Another benefit would be the ability to store data for postprocessing pourpuses (meh).
Some notable mentions using a similar design with a Sagnac loop are by
\cite{Neumann_Buchner_Bulla_Bohmann_Ursin_2022_PW,Chen_Ecker_Wengerowsky_Bulla_Joshi_Steinlechner_Ursin_2018_CW}.
In these works the entanglement is generated due to an ambiguity of of the origin of the photons.
There are also many linear, or single pass, designs such as \cite{Lee_Kim_Cha_Moon_2016,Kwiat_Mattle_Weinfurter_Zeilinger_Sergienko_Shih_1995}.
Here, the entanglement is a product of ambiguity of momentum conservation, as only specific cross sections of the two generated SPDC light cones are spatially indistinguishable.
An important measure on wether a source is performing well is it's brightness, bandwidth, and heralding. The brightness being a measure of how many "useful" photon pairs are produced,
bandwidth corresponds to how defined they are in frequency, as this is a limiting factor for certain interference measurements and also for coupling
to quantum memories, and the heralding being the probability, when measuring two photon correlations,
of finding a correlated photon when detecting the 1st one.
Brightness and heralding should be as high as possible in order to mitigate loss in fiber for fiber based networks,
reduce preprocessing load, and the bandidth to be as narrow as needed for efficient coupling to quantum devices such as quantum memories or repeaters, 
or for certain measurements as HBT and HOM, which will need to be performed for a full characterisation of the source.
% NOTE: What you want to do, how to do it, why important and how different from others
In the case of the current thesis I will use a 50 mm PPLN Type-0 SPDC crystal placed in a bulk Sagnac interferometer which will be bi-directionally 
pumped by a CW 780,24 nm laser. The pump will be set to a diagonal state ($\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{H} + \ket{V})$). On ariving to the 
PBS the beam is split into two. The reflected ($\ket{V}$) beam first passes through a halfwaveplate in order to rotate the polarization from $\ket{H}$ to $\ket{V}$
then through the crystal where it generates two $\ket{H}$ photons around 1560 nm, and then through the PBS $\ket{H}$ output where it gets combined 
with the now two $\ket{V}$ photons from the counter propagating branch.
The advantage of using SPDC for entanglement generation is that one can relatively efficiently generate the necesarry biphoton pairs 
compared to other methods (what are some other methods).
% The main challenge thus far will be

\section{Statement of hypotheses, research questions and research goals}
% (approximately one page)
% First, briefly recall the research problem.
% Next, clearly present the principal hypotheses (H) and/or research questions (R) and/or detailed research objectives (C).
% In most cases, just one of these three categories will be relevant. Clearly state which category it is; list the individual hypotheses (H1, H2, ..),
% research questions (R1, R2, ..) and/or detailed objectives (C1, C2, ..); and explain them briefly.
% In most PhD projects, the options of defining hypotheses or setting research questions are recommended.
% However, the possibility of stating detailed research objectives is permitted under the new University rules.
% Doctoral research projects are usually based on around three main research hypotheses,
% research questions or more detailed objectives, but this depends on the nature of the research.

\newpage
\section{Outline of research and research methods}
% (approximately one page)
% • Briefly outline the research and the planned research methodology.
% • Provide a more detailed outline of the planned research and its methodology; for example, approaches, methods (e.g., theoretical, experimental, simulation), phases of research, if applicable, also the planned scheduling of the phases.

To ensure stability, the pump laser wavelength will be locked to an absorption line in Rubidium gas using atomic spectroscopy via the $^{87}Rb$ $D_2$ transition \cite{metger2017sas}.
The entanglement will be generated by bi-directionally pumping the PPLN crystal in the center of the Sagnac interferometer,
introducing photon indistinguishability essential for these protocols.

We will use a Continous Wave (CW) 780 nm Toptica DLPro laser to pump a 50 mm nonlinear PPLN crystal which is phase matched for Type-0 SPDC (e $\rightarrow$ e + e, e meaning extraordinary polarization)
for generating entangled photons.
An existing Dark Fiber (DF) will be used for network testing once all of the local tests have been made, including QST, HBT, and HOM.
The DFs location is currently undisclosed.

Goal 0 - Build a Sagnac source of entanglement and reach the currently know state of the art in performance metrics such as brightness and heralding.

Goal 1 - Once we have a fully working source, we need to characterize it using QST, CHSH, HBT, and HOM for different pairs of DWDM channels (references).
% TODO Check frequency stabilization literature, doppler broadening, ..., PDH? Single pass, double pass, toptica homepage

Goal 2 - might need to introduce extra filtering -- 100 GHz not enough -> Filtering cavities
Long-term stability, locking, ...? Demonstrate Quantum Teleportation within the lab, and Entanglement swapping (we will use the same $\Phi^+$ or $\Phi^-$ Bell state,
then perform a Bell measurement on each part of the pair) with IJS, IJS Reactor, Beyond Semiconductor, where to do
long distance stuff (need fibers) other distant parties,

TODO: What is the work based on? Neumanns paper, introduce Bennik and Boyd for parameters,....

Goal 3 - Free space application using OAM modes, try to do entanglement in this regime?? topological photons
Put an SLM in one branch of the Sagnac and generate also OAM modes
Currently source creates Polarization and Frequency entanglement, adding the SLM thin film would make it a 3 for 1 source. A pulsed laser source would give 
also the possibility of time bin entanglement.

$\ket{H;+;\omega_s}\ket{H;+;\omega_i}+\ket{V;-;\omega_s}\ket{V;-;\omega_i}$

Why use CW instead of Pulsed Wave (PW)?
Advantages of Continuous Wave compared to Pulsed Laser entanglement sources:
How to then generate entanglement
How to stabilize the 780 laser to the Rubidium Gas Cell, some references for locking and such which we plan to use
Introduce HBT, HOM, Teleportation, Entanglement Swapping, Zeillinger, Rainer, others,

% Active polarization control
Another important part of a Quantum Network is polarization control \cite{CCSHDCDRS}. In order to measure the correct states the 
idea is to use an electronic polarization controller in the experimental network to create an algorithm which will be able to 
ensure the correct polarization state is being received on the measurement stage.

\newpage
\section{Expected results and original contributions to science}
% (approximately one side)
% • State the expected results of the research.
% • Clearly identify the expected original contributions to science deriving from the above results.
% (It is recommended to enumerate these contributions as an itemised list of usually up to five contributions.)
% • Briefly elaborate on the expected contributions. Since they are typically hypothetical at this stage, the contributions may be expressed in very broad or narrow terms, as appropriate.
% Original contributions include, e.g., original knowledge or findings, new theoretical models, original experimental or simulation methods, new approaches, newly opened areas, etc.
% Original contributions do not include, e.g., implementation of known methods, solutions of practical problems with known methods and similar.
% Developing and demonstrating methods of postprocessing for entanglement swapping from CW polarization entangled to be used in existing telecom infrastructure.
Depending on timing jitter how good the HOM would be, try to get as good as we can
Maybe need a compromise between integrading and stuff
Depending on visibility of the HOM this reduces the tangle of the source and whatnot
Check when visibility destroys entanglement

Original contributions: More engineering - filtering, jitter, 
Getting good SNR with CW -> In future maybe go to PL - working principle may be the same and might bring great imrpovement of HOM

Currently making good progress with brightness - but needs improvement of coupling/heralding

Working together with a company (mention maybe the experimental network from SiQuid)
