Dear Committee Members,
\vspace{1cm}

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request permission to write my PhD thesis in English.
As an international student and non-native speaker of Slovenian, I believe that completing my thesis in English would be beneficial for both academic and practical reasons.
Firstly, English is the primary language in my field of study, and the majority of relevant literature, research articles, and publications are available in English.
Writing my thesis in English would enable me to engage more directly with this body of work and ensure that my research is positioned within the global academic discourse.
Secondly, my supervisor, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Rainer Oliver Kaltenbaek, who is also a non-native speaker of Slovenian, has advised that conducting and evaluating the research in
English would facilitate clearer communication and collaboration throughout the thesis process. Furthermore, writing in English would allow for smoother peer review
and potential publication in international journals.
Lastly, most, if not all of the literature that I am using in my doctoral studies are in English and I believe it would slow down my progress to translate
all of the terminoligy and nomenclature to Slovenian.
I greatly appreciate your understanding and consideration of this request. I am confident that writing my thesis in English will enhance its academic
impact and contribute positively to my development as a researcher. Please let me know if further clarification or documentation is required to support this appeal.
Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your response.

\section{Description of the immediate research area and its problems}

In the rapidly advancing fields of quantum communication and quantum computing, sensing, and simulators
the efficient transfer of secure quantum information is of great importance.
A key quantum resource is entanglement, which enables experiments such as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping.
Conducting these experiments over long distances through optical fibers presents significant challenges due to transmission losses.
To mitigate this, photons must be generated at wavelengths compatible with existing fiber-optic networks,
particularly in the C band (near-infrared) where transmission losses are minimal.
One also has to use standard Wavelength Division Multiplexing due to high traffic of
such networks.
These advances contribute to the broader goal of realizing quantum networks,
which require robust capabilities for generating and characterizing aforementioned quantum processes.
Such networks rely on the distribution of entanglement and the teleportation of quantum states across network nodes \cite{Kimble_2008}.
Additionally, in areas where fiber connections are sparse,
free-space communication methods \cite{Kržić_et_al_2023} are being explored for applications in metropolitan areas. Sometimes,
these solutions are more practical and cost effective.
\par While these technologies are essential for local and metropolitan quantum networks, scaling to a global level requires overcoming
the inherent limitations of photon loss over long distances. This is where quantum repeaters and high-yield entanglement sources
play a critical role for the future global quantum internet. High-yield entanglement sources in in-between nodes, coupled to % NOTE: Explain this a bit more maybe
quantum repeaters may enable the distribution of entanglement over arbitrarily long distances by overcoming exponential loss scaling in fiber.
With no such in between nodes, entanglement distribution via fiber networks would be limited to distances of only a few hundred kilometers.
\par This work seeks to establish the technical bedrock for future scalable quantum networks. These efforts do not exist in isolation;
they directly feed into the broader goal of transforming theoretical quantum advantages into real-world systems.
I aim to achieve not only the first realization of a high-yield polarization entanglement source at non-degenerate
frequencies in Slovenia but also to demonstrate quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping using
continuous wave pump lasers which should be doable with the current technology. In the future, there is
also a possibility of using a pulsed laser for increased swapping efficiency.
Ongoing research efforts aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications,
driving the quest for more efficient and accessible quantum systems that could transform various sectors.
As these technologies mature, they are poised to redefine our understanding of information
processing and secure communications in the quantum era.
\par\textbf{Key words: Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Communication, Entanglement Swapping}

\section{Overview of related research and relevant literature}
Quantum entanglement sources are pivotal components in the field of quantum technologies, enabling the generation of entangled states
that are essential for a range of applications, including distributed quantum computing, cryptography, and communication.
These sources can produce pairs of entangled photons through various techniques such as micro-ring resonators \cite{Wakabayashi_2015},
quantum dot mechanisms \cite{Rota_2024}, and by far the most widely used method being Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion \cite{jesseSPDC} (SPDC).
The ability to create reliable and efficient entangled states has garnered significant interest due to their
implications for advancing quantum technologies and facilitating secure information transfer across long distances.
\par After one of the first \cite{Kwiat_1995} demonstrations of a polarization entangled source was realized,
research in this field advanced quickly. Some notable mentions using a similar design with a Sagnac loop
\cite{Neumann_Buchner_Bulla_Bohmann_Ursin_2022_CW,Chen_Ecker_Wengerowsky_Bulla_Joshi_Steinlechner_Ursin_2018_CW}
in which the entanglement is generated due to an ambiguity of the origin of the photons being overlapped on the Polarization Beam-Splitter (PBS).
There are also many linear, or single pass, designs such as \cite{Lee_Kim_Cha_Moon_2016,Kwiat_Mattle_Weinfurter_Zeilinger_Sergienko_Shih_1995}
where the entanglement is a product of ambiguity of momentum conservation, as only specific cross sections of the two generated SPDC light
cones are spatially indistinguishable.
\par An important measure of whether a source is performing well is its brightness, bandwidth, and heralding \cite{Bennink_2010,Ljunggren_Tengner_Marsden_Pelton_2006}.
The brightness being a measure of how many photon pairs are being produced, bandwidth corresponds to how well defined they are in frequency,
as this is a limiting factor for certain interference measurements like
Hong Oh and Mandel (HOM) \cite{Hong_Ou_Mandel_1987}, and also for coupling to quantum memories,
and the heralding being the probability, when measuring two photon correlations, of finding a correlated photon when detecting the 1st one.
Brightness and heralding should be as high as possible in order to mitigate loss in fiber for fiber based networks,
reduce preprocessing load, and the bandwidth to be as narrow as needed for efficient coupling to quantum devices such as quantum memories or repeaters,
or for measurements as HOM, which will need to be performed for a full characterisation of the source.
Afterwards, one can also perform a Hanbury Brown and Twiss \cite{Brown_Twiss_1954} experiment to check the line width of the filtered photons.
We will also perform Quantum State Tomography (QST) measurements, and CHSH inequality measurements \cite{Clauser_Horne_Shimony_Holt_1969}.
\par One of the first \cite{Halder_Beveratos_Jorel_Zbinden_Simon_Scarani_Gisin_2007} experimental demonstrations of entanglement
swapping by use of Continuous Wave (CW) lasers has shown that it is entirely possible to not use pulsed lasers for this purpose, but with less efficiency.
Afterwards, there were very few reports
on this. Somewhat recently, two \cite{Samara_Maring_Martin_Raja_Kippenberg_Zbinden_Thew_2021,Tsujimoto_Tanaka_Iwasaki_Ikuta_Miki_Yamashita_Terai_Yamamoto_Koashi_Imoto_2018}
interesting papers came out showing entanglement swapping using a micro-ring resonator and a PPLN waveguide. In the case of the micro-ring resonator, four-wave mixing
was used in order to generate the entangled pairs in the two source setups, while in the case of the PPLN waveguide a single laser was used for pumping both SPDC crystals.
To the best of my knowledge, we will be the first to try to show entanglement swapping by two completely independent bulk sources, using completely independent measurement
and analysis tools while pumping with a CW laser.
% TODO: Talk to Rainer about the one above
\par We want to build a new high-yielding source of entangled photons which can later be used as part of a research network
for conducting multiple experiments simultaneously. It should be broad enough to supply these demands, and bright enough
that further filtering does not diminish the signal to an unusable amount. This will become important for future quantum
networks as well, as they may require narrower bandwidths for efficient coupling to quantum memories or quantum repeaters.
Pulsed Laser (PL) sources, which offer higher peak power and possibly fewer synchronization constraints.
A benefit to using CW lasers as compared to pulsed lasers is less maintenance and lower cost, for instance in an industrial or government
setting where access may be limited. This is the research path in which I will be going.
The main reason for using a CW laser instead of a PL is due to our involvement in a EuroQCI project called the Slovenian
Quantum Communication Infrastructure Demonstration (\href{https://siquid.fmf.uni-lj.si/}{SiQUID}). The source will be used also for various Quantum
Key Distribution (QKD) protocols based on entanglement in the scope of the SiQUID project.
\par Another possible approach for the future is to miniaturize the source and create
an on chip variant, as has been shown by different groups for frequency-bin entanglement \cite{S_G_S_C_F_B_L_G_B_2022},
polarization entanglement \cite{L_Z_F_F_L_L_W_R_D_X_etal._2017}, and also for hybrid frequency-polarization
entangled states \cite{F_R_D_F_L_M_A_B_D_2023}.
Creating a chip based source is another possible avenue for the future which may be explored at some time in our group.

\section{Research questions and goals}
The overarching goal of this thesis is to develop a high-yield,
broadband source of entangled photons suitable for quantum networks and laboratory-based quantum research,
as well as to demonstrate entanglement swapping with another completely independent source.
Future quantum networks must be capable of supplying entangled photon pairs to multiple users with high fidelity and efficiency.
This requires a source that is not only bright and stable but also spectrally broad enough to support multiple experiments and network nodes.
The main goals (C) and questions (R) of this thesis are listed as follows:

% TODO: Finish making this pretty

		      and after filtering what would be the new bandwidth by performing a HBT experiment and brightness of the source for that channel?
	\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\par These objectives and research questions define the scope of this thesis,
guiding the experimental work and theoretical analysis required to advance the state of the art
of broadband entanglement sources for quantum communication and networking.
% \newpage
\section{Outline of research and research methods}
The focus of this thesis is to implement a Sagnac interferometer source of polarization-entangled photons centered around 1560 nm,
designed to be sufficiently broadband to accommodate multiple DWDM frequency channels.
In the case of the current thesis I will use a 50 mm Periodically polled Lithium Niobate (PPLN)
Type-0 SPDC ($e_{\mathrm{pump}} \rightarrow e_{\mathrm{signal}} + e_{\mathrm{idler}}$) crystal placed in a Sagnac interferometer
which will be bi-directionally pumped by a CW 780.24 nm laser.
\par The CW pump will be set to a diagonal polarization state ($\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{H_{\mathrm{pump}}} + \ket{V_{\mathrm{pump}}})$). On arriving to the
PBS the beam is split into two. The reflected ($\ket{V_{\mathrm{pump}}}$) beam first passes through a half-wave plate (HWP) in order to rotate the
polarization from $\ket{V_{\mathrm{pump}}}$ to $\ket{H_{\mathrm{pump}}}$, as is required by phase matching conditions (in the actual setup the crystal is rotated by 90° along the beam axis), then through
the crystal where it generates two $\ket{H_{\mathrm{signal}\ (\mathrm{idler})}}$ photons around 1560 nm, and then through the PBSs $\ket{H}$ output where it gets recombined
with the now two $\ket{V_{\mathrm{signal}\ (\mathrm{idler})}}$ photons from the counter propagating branch.

After the two bi-photon pairs pass through the PBS they are reflected by a dichroic mirror, and diverted into a collimating lens
after which they are finally coupled into single mode fiber. The photons from opposing directions will then be in a
$\Phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \ket{H_{\mathrm{signal}}H_{\mathrm{idler}}} + e^{i \phi}\ket{V_{\mathrm{signal}}V_{\mathrm{idler}}}\right)$ Bell state.
In order to choose any of the two available Bell states, in the pump beam path, we will have
a relative phase setter between the two counter propagating paths, consisting of a two quarter-wave plates (QWP), and a HWP between them.
The QWPs are set to $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the HWP is used to set the appropriate phase to select one of the $\Phi$ Bell states.
\par To maximize the efficiency of these telecom networks for multiple users, the available bandwidth (approximately 7400 GHz, or 60 nm)
is divided into many frequency channels using a DWDM.

For all of the tests a DWDM of roughly 100 GHz channel bandwidth, or 0.81 nm, will be used. For simply checking whether the source
produces entangled pairs it is enough violate the CHSH inequality. We have chosen to do this in the linear basis as it requires
only two HWPs and two PBSs. The measurement basis' here are then offset by $\frac{\pi}{8}$. After this
we will perform a QST measurement to reconstruct \cite{James_Kwiat_Munro_White_2001} the density matrix of the entangled state.
In order to measure the actual bandwidth of our DWDM channels a HBT measurement will be performed, and also a HOM measurement.
Subsequently, quantum teleportation \cite{Bouwmeester_Pan_Mattle_Eibl_Weinfurter_Zeilinger_1997}
and entanglement swapping \cite{Jennewein_Weihs_Pan_Zeilinger_2001} experiments will be conducted in collaboration with the Jožef Stefan Institute (JSI)
entanglement lab, who will develop a similar entanglement source with our assistance.

To ensure stability, the pump laser wavelength will be locked to an absorption line in Rubidium gas using atomic spectroscopy
via the $^{87}Rb$ $D_2$ transition \cite{metger2017sas}. A small percentage of the pump beam will be diverted into a separate
setup where it will be further split into counter two propagating beams passing through a gas cell for cancelling Doppler broadening,
and a reference beam going straight through the gas cell. The reference beam and one of the counter propagating signal beams will be
coupled to a balanced photodiode, and the error signal will be fed into the laser controller for locking.

In order for two distant parties to be able to measure the correct time tags for analysis, each party will have to synchronize
to a reference. Options are currently being explored on how to exactly do this. A proposed idea is to use GPS clocks which are disciplined
regularly in both locations which will be set as the external clock input of the time taggers. Currently, tests are being made
to see whether this approach will works for us. Another idea was to use an atomic reference.%, but as one might imagine, these are an expensive solution.

Regarding the short distance free space test, we will likely engineer or buy a basic telescope sender and receiver station.
We will follow the procedure developed here by \cite{Kržič_2024}. Upon completion, I will test entanglement swapping via free space
link. This setup will be used primarily for another project of the group, where 1324 nm photons will be generated in a non-degenerate SPDC process
along with 852 nm photons in order to couple to a quantum memory device built by JSI. For this purpose, they must teleport the entanglement from a local 852 nm photon
generated by our group to the IJS group, and in order to do so we need the 1560 nm free space link continuous wave swapping protocol completed.

The last part of the thesis will be about active polarization control % via a closed loop algorithm such as neural networks.
\cite{CCSHDCDRS}. In order to measure the correct states, the
idea is to use an electronic polarization controller in the experimental network to create an algorithm which will be able to
ensure the correct polarization state is being received on the measurement stage.

All of the measurements for this thesis will be performed using Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) ID281 from IDQuantique. The
measurements at JSI will be performed using SNSPDs from Single Quantum.


\section{Expected results and original contributions to science}
Lastly, I will talk about the expected entanglement swapping rate that we hope to achieve, and also the HOM interference visibility, which
is an important measurement for achieving entanglement swapping. Currently, without any optimizations in regards to heralding
or brightness the source is capable of producing around 35000 correlated pairs per second, per branch of the Sagnac loop.
Using this, and the estimated coincidence window of 300 ps, a rate of around 0.3 four-folds per second should be achievable.
This would mean that in order to gather enough four-folds for a HOM measurement, one would have to integrate for roughly 10 minutes per point.
To the best of my knowledge, this would be a new record result for CW HOM, and it might open other possibilities for further research.
I have assumed that the jitter of the detectors and time tagger is Gaussian. The goal of the thesis is also to improve the above mentioned
values to their respective theoretical limits.
\par To assess the impact of timing jitter on the quality of interference measurements, consider the bandwidth of the SPDC photons, which we assume
to be 100 GHz. This corresponds to a coherence time of approximately 10 ps, and assuming the total measurement timing jitter is estimated
to be 44 ps by using the Root Sum of Variances method.
The maximum visibility of the HOM interference measurement that one can hope for then is around 20\%, which is well below the minimal value for violating
Bells inequality.
This then leads to a rough estimate for the minimal value of the coherence time for the SPDC photons to 100 ps for the HOM measurement, possibly even larger.
Hypothetically, assuming such a total timing jitter without including synchronization jitter we can expect to get a visibility of at most 91\%. Clearly,
adding in synchronization will reduce this number even farther for that coherence time, and increasing the coherence time would then also increase it proportionally.
\par In order for the measurement to not take too long, but still give desirable results, there might need to be a compromise
between the bandwidth and integration time for the HOM measurement. For Type-0 SPDC there should be a linear relationship between the brightness
and the amount of filtering being done, as the process is quite broad and flat around the maximum.
Filtering will of course also reduce the amount of coincidences we will be able to see.

% Possible TODO Working together with a company (mention maybe the experimental network from SiQuid)

\section{Draft plan for management of research data}
During my doctoral research, I will collect and analyze time tagger data,
which records photon detection events with precise timestamps.
The data will be stored in CSV files and analyzed using C++ and Python scripts.

To ensure data integrity and reproducibility, I will organize my research data as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Raw data (time tagger outputs) will be stored in a structured directory on one of our laboratory computers, sorted by experiment date and parameters.
	\item Processed data (results of filtering, calibration, and analysis) will be saved in separate CSV files, maintaining a clear relationship with the raw data.
	\item Analysis scripts (C++ and Python code) will be version-controlled using Git.
\end{itemize}
For long-term storage and accessibility, I plan to deposit my research data in an appropriate open-access data repository,
such as the University of Ljubljana Repository. The dataset will include:
% such as Zenodo, Figshare, or the University of Ljubljana Repository. The dataset will include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Metadata describing the experiment setup, parameters, and conditions.
	\item Raw and processed CSV data,
\end{itemize}

Documentation explaining the data structure and how to reproduce the results using the provided scripts.
The data will be made available upon request unless confidentiality or ethical restrictions apply.
When sharing, I will ensure compliance with FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reusability) by providing proper documentation and referencing my datasets in publications.
